<p>Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jos Polfliet, and the reason I get up every day is to make the world more automated, more efficient and evidence-based. My specialty is in Machine and Deep Learning, with a special interest in Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>My passion is in <strong>applying</strong> Artificial Intelligence. That means I am committed and focussed on doing <em>useful</em> things with A.I.</p>
<p>In the past and present, I had the opportunity to successfully apply Machine Learning at</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://metamaze.eu/">Metamaze</a> - information extraction, responsible for NLP team (current)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.faktion.com/">Faktion</a> - end responsible for all projects related to Machine Learning. Lead ML projects for clients like Bridgestone, Bank van Breda, GIS International and many more under NDA. (current)</li>
<li><a href="https://chatlayer.ai/">Chatlayer</a> - natural language understanding, responsible for NLP team from April 2017 to February 2019</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sas.com/en_be/home.html">SAS Belgium and Canada</a> - implementing machine learning projects in natural language processing and predictive maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>My passion does not include contributing to &ldquo;useless AI&rdquo; like building Reinforcement Learning agents to play Atari games, nor does it include writing academic papers. Both create fascinating results regularly, but I have chosen to specialize in effectively applying those results to something that benefits us all more directly.</p>
<p>I am originally a mathematician, having studied at the great Mathematics department of Ghent University. I started programming by watching my father when I was about 8 years old.</p>

<h4 id="pandas-profiling">pandas-profiling</h4>
<p>I am the original creator of <a href="https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling">pandas-profiling</a>.</p>
<p>Pandas-profiling generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. With &gt;5k GitHub stars and &gt;100k monthly downloads, pandas-profiling has been named one of the Top 20 ML packages by Google.</p>
<p>Since May 2019, principal development has been taken over by Simon Brugman.</p>

<p>We created an A.I. Lab Assistant that helped lab workers to fill in their electronic lab notebooks.</p>
<h4 id="data-impact-challenge">Data Impact Challenge</h4>
<p>In this competition, I worked on the winning submission to analyze social media data to predict the risk of suicide and mental health issues. The prize money ($10,000) was donated to two suicide prevention charities.</p>
<p>The organizer was Canada Health Infoway (Infoway), an independent, not-for-profit organization funded by the federal government to help improve the health of Canadians.</p>

<p>Outside of my passion for applying technology, I am interested in many topics. A couple of them are highlighted here.</p>
<h3 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h3>
<p>I am striving to living carbon neutral in 2020 and after. I accomplish that by trying to reducing my carbon footprint by mostly eating plant-based food and living close to work (10 min bike ride). The (inevitable) carbon I do produce, I offset.</p>
<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I give stars to every book I read, and even sometimes write short reviews with my thoughts. You can find recommendations on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16729160-jos-polfliet">my Goodreads profile</a>. I typically read</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-fiction</li>
<li>Science Fiction, especially hard sci-fi and space opera</li>
<li>Exceptionally great fiction books, historical or contemporary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sports">Sports</h3>
<p>I like doing sports. My regular sports are</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock climbing (up to grade 6b) and alpine climbing (up to grade AD)</li>
<li>Running. You can follow me on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/18813236">Strava</a>.</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="volunteering---scouts-not-active-anymore">Volunteering - Scouts (not active anymore)</h3>
<p>I joined SGV Mgr. Bermijn as a young &ldquo;kapoen&rdquo; when I was just six years old. Wether it was working on projects together, having passionate conversations, playing tiresome games in the local fields or making fun of each other, I&rsquo;ve never felt more at home in a place as in the Scouts. I strongly believe in its positive impact on its members, and therefore society as well.</p>
<p>Following the natural progression of a scout&rsquo;s career, I joined the team of leaders when I was 18 years old. After a couple of years, I wanted to help more to benefit the ongoing organisation and joined the &ldquo;groepsleiding&rdquo;, which is a three people management team. In this function, I was responsible for a small team of 30 volunteers who organise activities for about 200 members. This includes budget management, event planning, motivating and creative problem-solving.</p>
<h2 id="tcsup2sup">TC<sup>2</sup>?<a class="anchor" href="#tcsup2sup">#</a></h2>
<p>Tau Ceti is one of the closest star systems believed to have planets in the goldilocks zone where liquid water is possible. That means Tau Ceti is one of the closest systems with the potential to harbor extra-terresttial micro-bacterial life.</p>
<p>Tau Ceti Consulting is inspired by Tau Ceti Center (TC<sup>2</sup>), the capital of the universe in the magnificent Hyperion Cantos saga.</p>
