## Topics i'm interested in
* Machine Learning with a special interest in Natural Language Processing
* Sustainability. I am striving to living carbon neutral in 2020 and beyond. I accomplish that by trying to reducing my carbon footprint by mostly eating plant-based food and living close to work (10 min bike ride). The inevitable carbon I do produce, I offset. 
* Reading. I give stars to every book I read, and even sometimes write short reviews with my thoughts. You can find recommendations on [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/16729160-jos-polfliet). 
* Sports (rock climbing, running and yoga)
* Entrepreneurship


## TC<sup>2</sup>? 
Tau Ceti Consulting is inspired by Tau Ceti Center (TC-square), the capital of the universe in the Hyperion Cantos saga. It is also one of the closest star systems believed to have planets in the goldilocks zone.
