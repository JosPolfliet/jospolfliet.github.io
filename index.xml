      <description>whoami Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jos Polfliet, and the reason I get up every day is to make the world more automated, more efficient and evidence-based. My specialty is in Machine and Deep Learning, with a special interest in Natural Language Processing.
My passion is in applying Artificial Intelligence. That means I am committed and focussed on doing useful things with A.I.
In the past and present, I had the opportunity so successfully apply Machine Learning at</description>

I believe A.I. beats humans at many, many tasks and on many different criteria A well developed algorithm is more fair than any person, as we can explicitly control for bias instead of being driven by unconscious bias.</description>
