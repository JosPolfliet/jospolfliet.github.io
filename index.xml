      <description>Advice for people wanting to learn ML First things first: consider alternatives ML is super cool and hip. But at the moment there is an over supply of Junior Machine Learning Engineers. There is however a huge shortage of Data Engineers and Python Software Developers. If you care more about your career path, opportunities and salary, you should NOT choose to work in ML. If you care about data and statistics, you should choose ML.</description>

      <description>whoami Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jos Polfliet, and the reason I get up every day is to make the world more automated, more efficient and more evidence-based. My specialty is in Machine and Deep Learning, with a special interest in Natural Language Processing.
My passion is in applying Artificial Intelligence. That means I am committed and focussed on doing useful things with A.I.
In the past and present, I had the opportunity to successfully apply Machine Learning at</description>

      <description>Why do I work in A.I.?
I believe that algorithms can make better decisions than humans. I have an undying, relentless optimism that even the hardest societal problems can be tackled by applying technology and Artificial Intelligence. I&amp;rsquo;m a fanatic - even cult-like - techno-optimist.
I believe A.I. beats humans at many, many tasks and on many different criteria A well-developed algorithm is more fair than any person, as we can explicitly control for bias instead of being driven by unconscious bias.</description>
