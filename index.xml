      <description>Advice for people wanting to learn ML First things first: consider alternatives Machine Learning is a tremendously exciting field. But at the moment there is a slight oversupply of Junior-level Machine Learning Engineers or Data Scientists. There is however a huge shortage of Data Engineers and Python Software Developers. If you care more about your career path, opportunities, and salary, you can also choose to NOT work in ML. If you care about data and statistics, you should choose ML though.</description>

      <description>Zero carbon humans I like our planet. A lot. But as a 2020 human, is it even possible to live on earth with a positive impact instead of a negative one? Do I need to live as a hermit in a treehouse to do so?
Companies everywhere are pledging to become carbon neutral. Can individuals do the same? Surely, that must be expensive, right? Infeasible even. What does it cost? Where can I even pay such a fee?</description>

      <description>ML Architecture from zero to one If you would follow all best practices on the internet with regards to coding and technical architecture, start-ups would take multiple years and huge budgets to get an MVP, while you only have limited time, money and people. I created this list out of experience on what to focus on in which stage of building a new company, and which best practices you can safely ignore at different stages.</description>

      <description>whoami Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Jos Polfliet, and the reason I get up every day is to make the world more automated, more efficient, and more evidence-based. My specialty is in Machine and Deep Learning, with a special interest in Natural Language Processing.
My passion is in applying Artificial Intelligence by building A.I. powered products. That means I am committed and focused on doing useful things with A.I.
In the past and present, I had the opportunity to successfully help with, lead, or teach about building Machine Learning products at</description>

      <description>Why do I work in A.I.?
I believe that good algorithms can make better decisions than humans. I have an undying, relentless optimism that even the hardest societal problems can be tackled by applying technology and Artificial Intelligence. I&amp;rsquo;m a fanatic - even cult-like - techno-optimist.
I believe A.I. beats humans at many, many tasks and on many different criteria A well-developed algorithm is more fair than any person, as we can explicitly control for bias instead of being driven by unconscious bias.</description>
